SETTING UP YOUR DEVICE FOR AWS DEVELOPMENT (SETUP)

    1. Install dependencies:
        - Jupyter and Anaconda
        - Your preferred IDE
        - Create virtual environment* for easier development (optional)
        - Python requirements (on requirements.txt)
        - and more

    2. Create user for AWS SageMaker:
        1. Search for IAM and open IAM on AWS
        2. Go to IAM resources
        3. Press on the 'Users' number
        4. Press on 'Create User'
        5. Insert the user name for SageMaker
        6. Give AdministratorAccess permission on the user
        7. Create user

    3. Create access key for AWS SageMaker:
        1. Go to the SageMaker user that was made on step (2)
        2. Go to 'Security credentials'
        3. Go to 'Access keys' and press 'Create access key'
        4. Choose the desired use case (for this project, we'll going to use CLI)
        5. Confirm to create access key
        6. Insert description tag value (optional)
        7. Create access key
        8. Download as .csv for the next steps and for easier next development

    4. Configure AWS on Anaconda:
        1. Open Anaconda prompt
        2. Write 'aws configure' on the Anaconda prompt
        3. Insert both Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
        4. Insert default region name (just press enter if you don't want to change it)
        5. Insert default output format (just press enter if you don't want to change it)

    5. Create S3 bucket for cloud storage:
        1. Search for S3 and open S3 on AWS
        2. Create bucket

    Virtual environment:

    - How to create virtual environment:
        - Anaconda:
            1. Create a new folder for your environment and workspace
            2. Copy the folder's path (for easier creation)
            3. Open Anaconda prompt
            4. Write 'cd ' and paste your folder's path
            5. Write 'conda create -p [your_env_name] python=[your_python_version] [extra_package_you_want_to_install]' or 'conda create --prefix [your_env_name] python=[your_python_version] [extra_package_you_want_to_install]'
        
        - Python:
            1. Create a new folder for your environment and workspace
            2. Copy the folder's path (for easier creation)
            3. Open command prompt
            4. Write 'cd ' and paste your folder's path
            5. Write 'py -[desired_python_version] -m venv [your_env_name]'
    
    - Access virtual environment:
        - Anaconda:
            1. Open command prompt
            2. Change directory to your environment directory
            3. Write 'conda activate [your_env_name]/\'
        
        - Python:
            1. Open command prompt
            2. Change directory to your environment directory, then go to \Scripts
            3. Write 'activate.bat'
        
        After that, you can do anything you want to the virtual environment.
